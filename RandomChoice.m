function chiffre = RandomChoice(p)

% p is a vector of N elements representing probabilities of occurence of N concurrent options

% function drand01 consists in stochastically choosing among possible
% options depending on their respective probabilities

% chiffre is the output of drand01. It is an integer containing the number
% of the option that was chosen by drand01

    if ((j <= cumul)|(i == length(p))),
